# CONCERT PAGE
The concert page is a web-based project that shows upcoming events as well as the speakers who will be presenting at these events. The project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is intended to provide users with an easy-to-use interface that allows them to view all of the necessary details of upcoming concerts and speakers in one place. Users can quickly and easily plan which events they want to attend and learn more about the speakers presenting at these events with clear and concise information about the events and speakers.
